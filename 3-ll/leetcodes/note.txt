x=y;
set place/pointer(move) to place/value
pointer dont have value value wont move pointer
places also doesnt have value pretty much like pointer


before.next= temp.next; skip over remove temp


so there are

-move pointer  pntx=pntxy.next

-remove by skipping over  prev.next=cur.next  remove cur.next
*before.next=after.next ==SKIP
-reverse /for length -1 /dummy head/ 3 pnts /reverse skip remove  next/ / reverse next.next to prev.next / move reversed next to prev.next at front
*after.next=before.next ==reverse

*link.next = link.next or this.head = merg links
-merg dummy lists prev1.next=dummy2.next  //front needs to be next when adding value cause ifit jsut prev1 that means pointer

-put the value in place pntx.next=pnty

-temp = this.head.value //store value in vaiable temp



note that remove in between and pop& shift is different
